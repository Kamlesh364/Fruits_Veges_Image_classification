# Fruits and Vegetables Packaging Automation using Computer Vision
In this project, the aim is to automate the packaging process of fruits and vegetables using computer vision. The goal is to develop a robust image classification model that can accurately identify and classify different fruits and vegetables. This model will be integrated into an automated packaging line, ensuring that each item is correctly sorted and packed into the corresponding bundle for sale or further processing. This repository presents information and `Python` code related to the following-

```
1. Dataset
2. Dataset understanding and Visualization
3. Dataset pre-processing and preparation
4. Training methodology and pipelines
5. Trained models and their weights
6. Inference on saved weights
7. Performance analysis
```
